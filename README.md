> A comprehensive, accessible digital literacy platform designed specifically for older adults to bridge the digital divide through personalized learning and community support.

## 🎯 Purpose & Problem Statement

The digital divide disproportionately affects older adults, with **37% of seniors reporting difficulty using technology** (Pew Research Center, 2021). ByteSteps addresses this critical gap by providing:

- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Adaptive assessments that tailor content to individual skill levels
- **Accessibility-First Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant interface with large touch targets (44px minimum)
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Ensures continuity in areas with poor connectivity
- **Human Support Integration**: Bridges digital learning with real-world assistance

## 🔬 Research Foundation

This platform is built on evidence-based practices from geriatric technology adoption research:

### Key Research Insights Applied:
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Simplified interfaces with progressive disclosure (Sweller, 2011)
- **Social Cognitive Theory**: Peer learning integration and confidence building (Bandura, 1986)
- **Technology Acceptance Model**: Emphasis on perceived usefulness and ease of use (Davis, 1989)
- **Age-Related Design Guidelines**: Following NIH guidelines for senior-friendly interfaces

### Accessibility Standards Compliance:
- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- ✅ **Section 508**: Government accessibility standards
- ✅ **ADA Compliance**: Americans with Disabilities Act requirements
- ✅ **GDPR Ready**: Privacy-by-design with explicit consent mechanisms
